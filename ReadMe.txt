Identify Patient suffering diabetes or not !!

In this project we have use Keras framework. we differentiate the person based on health. if the person is suffering with diabetes then it will display as "Patients" 
otherwise it will be called as "healthy" it just takes image of you eye and print out result with 97% accuracy.

Note: 

I hope you get enough knowledge for this project and one important thing is the dataset path which i had given while coding in my pc that dataset was already downloaded in my pc and i had just given path from my local pc to this model so you can use your path once you download it in you pc.
